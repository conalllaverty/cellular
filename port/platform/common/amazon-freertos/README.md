You won't find build files or build instructions for Amazon FreeRTOS in here!  This folder simply holds a few files which are common to all platforms which support Amazon FreeRTOS.  For build files, build instructions and tests you need to look under the chipset platform (e.g. Espressif).  If that chipset platform has support for Amazon FreeRTOS you will find the build stuff for Amazon FreeRTOS in its `sdk` directory.
